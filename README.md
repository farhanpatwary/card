# Card
This is the back end application for Card, a digital business card I have built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB - Express.js - React.js - Node.js).  

If you want to try the deployed application click [Here](http://fast-card.herokuapp.com/).   
**Note that the application is deployed on Heroku and may take up to a minute to load since the application closes after a period of inactivity.**

# About this repository
I have built this repo using [this repo](https://github.com/farhanpatwary/express-backend) as a starting point. 
It contains all of the boilerplate code to get a web server set up as well as a database connection. More details on the repository's page and [wiki](https://github.com/farhanpatwary/express-backend/wiki).
