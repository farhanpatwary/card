# Card
This is the back end application for Card, a digital business card I have built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB - Express.js - React.js - Node.js).  

If you want to try the deployed application click [Here](http://fast-card.herokuapp.com/).   
**Note that the application is deployed on heroku and may take up to a minute to load since the application closes after a period of inactivity.**   

The backend for the application can be found [Here](https://github.com/farhanpatwary/card).
